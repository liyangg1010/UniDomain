"""
PDDL Planner Interface
======================

This module provides a wrapper around the Fast Downward planner (or compatible
PDDL solvers). It handles process execution, timeout management, parallel
planning, and result parsing.

Architecture Position:
    [Tools / Planner] -> Used by task_planner.planning and atomic_domain modules
    to solve PDDL problems.
